		I'm Vardhan Patil, a first year Computer Science student at D Y Patil
		Polytechnic, Kasaba Bawada, Kolhapur. I'm 16 years old
	</p>

	<p>
		I completed my 10th grade from the National Institute of Open Schooling,
		and was homeschooled. Before that, I have attended New English Medium
		School, Sanjay Ghodawat International School, and Podar International
		School.
	</p>

	<p>
		Roughly in 2018, I learned the basics of programming, and started using
		linux a few months later.
	</p>

	<p>
		Later on, I learned basics of DSA and web development using CS50, and
		learned various JavaScript frameworks, including svelte, react,
		solid.js, astro. I'm currently trying to learn operating systems
		development for fun, and am developing <a
